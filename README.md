💰 Monthly Salary Payment Process - Simple Guide
🌟 What This System Does
This system helps companies pay their employees' salaries in a fair and transparent way. Both managers and employees can check everything is correct before money is transferred.

👥 Who's Involved
🏢 Admin/Manager: The person who handles payroll and payments
👤 Employee: The person receiving the salary

📅 Monthly Process (Step by Step)
STEP 1: Manager Prepares Salaries 📊
What happens:

Manager calculates everyone's monthly salary
Includes basic pay, overtime, bonuses, deductions
Sends salary details to each employee for checking
Employee gets notification: "Your salary details are ready for review"

STEP 2: Employee Checks Their Salary 👀
What employee sees:

Their salary breakdown (basic pay, bonuses, deductions)
Final amount they'll receive
A button to review it
Employee has 2 choices:

✅ "Looks Good" - Accept the salary as calculated
❓ "I Have Questions" - Report if something seems wrong
STEP 3A: If Employee Says "Looks Good" ✅
What happens next:

Manager gets notified that employee approved
Manager can now approve the payment
Money gets transferred to employee
Employee gets confirmation: "Your salary has been paid"
Process complete! 🎉

STEP 3B: If Employee Says "I Have Questions" ❓
What happens:

Employee writes their concern (e.g., "Missing overtime hours")
Manager receives the feedback
Manager reviews the issue
Manager has 3 options:

Option 1: "You're Right, But No Changes Needed"
Manager explains the situation
Approves payment as-is
Employee gets paid
Option 2: "You're Right, Let Me Fix This"
Manager explains what they'll change
Manager updates the salary amounts
Employee gets to review the corrected amounts
Process continues from Step 2
Option 3: "Let Me Explain Better"
Manager provides more explanation
Sends back to employee for another look
Employee can approve or ask more questions
🔄 If Changes Are Made
When manager fixes salary amounts:

Employee gets notification: "Your salary has been updated - please check the changes"
Employee reviews new amounts
Employee can:
✅ Approve the corrected salary
❓ Ask more questions if still not satisfied
Process continues until everyone agrees

🎯 Real Example
Sarah's March Salary:

Manager calculates: Basic $3000 + Overtime $200 - Tax $320 = $2880
Sarah reviews and thinks: "I worked 10 overtime hours, not 5"
Sarah clicks "I Have Questions" and writes her concern
Manager checks records and finds Sarah is right
Manager updates: Basic $3000 + Overtime $400 - Tax $340 = $3060
Sarah gets notification to review updated amount
Sarah approves the corrected $3060
Manager processes payment
Sarah receives $3060 in her bank account ✅

Letting employees check their salary before payment
Providing easy way to ask questions
Keeping records of all discussions
Ensuring transparency in the payment process
