# Read-Only Database Validation Tests

## üõ°Ô∏è **Read-Only Security Implementation**

The AI database interaction system now enforces **strict read-only access** to prevent any write operations to the database.

---

## üîí **Security Features Implemented**

### **1. ReadOnlyDatabaseGuard**
- **Blocks all write operations** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, etc.)
- **Allows only safe read operations** (SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN)
- **Comprehensive SQL analysis** with multiple validation layers
- **Detailed logging** of blocked attempts for security monitoring

### **2. Multi-Layer Validation**
```php
$validations = [
    'operation_type' => $this->validateOperationType($sql),
    'dangerous_patterns' => $this->validateDangerousPatterns($sql),
    'write_keywords' => $this->validateWriteKeywords($sql),
    'function_calls' => $this->validateFunctionCalls($sql),
    'system_operations' => $this->validateSystemOperations($sql)
];
```

### **3. Integration Points**
- **DatabaseValidationAgent** - First validation layer
- **IntelligentRetryAgent** - Validates before execution
- **All AI Services** - Comprehensive protection

## ‚úÖ **Allowed Operations**

### **Safe Read-Only Operations:**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ ALLOWED: Basic SELECT queries
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM departments;
SELECT firstname, lastname FROM employees ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;

-- ‚úÖ ALLOWED: JOINs and complex queries
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, d.department 
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- ‚úÖ ALLOWED: Aggregations
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) as employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id;

-- ‚úÖ ALLOWED: Database information
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE employees;
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 1;

-- ‚úÖ ALLOWED: WITH clauses (CTEs)
WITH dept_counts AS (
    SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) as count 
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY department_id
) 
SELECT * FROM dept_counts;
```

---

## ‚ùå **Blocked Operations**

### **Write Operations (Completely Blocked):**
```sql
-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: INSERT operations
INSERT INTO employees (firstname, lastname) VALUES ('John', 'Doe');

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: UPDATE operations  
UPDATE employees SET basic_salary = 50000 WHERE id = 1;

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: DELETE operations
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: Schema modifications
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN new_field VARCHAR(255);
DROP TABLE employees;
CREATE TABLE test_table (id INT);
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: Transaction operations
START TRANSACTION;
BEGIN;
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK;

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: Permission operations
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user;
REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user;

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: System operations
FLUSH TABLES;
RESET QUERY CACHE;
KILL 123;
```

### **Dangerous Functions (Blocked):**
```sql
-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: File operations
SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd');
SELECT * FROM employees INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/data.txt';

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: System functions
SELECT BENCHMARK(1000000, MD5('test'));
SELECT SLEEP(10);

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: User/system information
SELECT USER();
SELECT SYSTEM_USER();
SELECT CONNECTION_ID();
```

### **SQL Injection Patterns (Blocked):**
```sql
-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: Union-based injection
SELECT * FROM employees UNION SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: Boolean-based injection
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 1=1 OR 1=1;

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED: Multiple statement injection
SELECT * FROM employees; DROP TABLE employees;
```

## üîç **Validation Process**

### **Step-by-Step Validation:**

#### **1. Operation Type Check**
```php
// Extract main operation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, etc.)
$operation = $this->extractMainOperation($sql);

// Check against allowed operations
if (!in_array($operation, $this->allowedOperations)) {
    throw new \Exception("Write operation '{$operation}' is not allowed");
}
```

#### **2. Dangerous Pattern Detection**
```php
$dangerousPatterns = [
    '/INTO\s+OUTFILE/i' => 'File output operations',
    '/LOAD_FILE\s*\(/i' => 'File reading functions',
    '/;\s*(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE)/i' => 'Multiple statement injection'
];

foreach ($dangerousPatterns as $pattern => $description) {
    if (preg_match($pattern, $sql)) {
        throw new \Exception("Dangerous pattern detected: {$description}");
    }
}
```

#### **3. Write Keyword Validation**
```php
$writeKeywords = [
    'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE', 'DROP', 'CREATE', 'ALTER', 
    'TRUNCATE', 'GRANT', 'REVOKE', 'COMMIT', 'ROLLBACK'
];

foreach ($writeKeywords as $keyword) {
    if (preg_match('/\b' . preg_quote($keyword, '/') . '\b/i', $sql)) {
        throw new \Exception("Write keyword '{$keyword}' is not allowed");
    }
}
```

#### **4. Function Call Validation**
```php
$dangerousFunctions = [
    'LOAD_FILE', 'INTO OUTFILE', 'BENCHMARK', 'SLEEP', 'USER'
];

foreach ($dangerousFunctions as $function) {
    if (preg_match('/\b' . preg_quote($function, '/') . '\b/i', $sql)) {
        throw new \Exception("Dangerous function '{$function}' is not allowed");
    }
}
```

## üö® **Security Monitoring**

### **Blocked Attempt Logging:**
```php
// Application logs
Log::warning('Read-Only Database Guard - Blocked write attempt', [
    'user_id' => $userId,
    'user_role' => $userRole,
    'sql_query' => $sqlQuery,
    'original_question' => $originalQuestion,
    'block_reason' => $reason,
    'ip_address' => request()->ip(),
    'timestamp' => now()
]);

// Database audit trail
AiDatabaseOperation::create([
    'user_id' => $userId,
    'operation_type' => 'blocked_write_attempt',
    'query_analysis' => [
        'read_only_guard' => 'blocked',
        'security_level' => 'high_risk',
        'block_reason' => $reason
    ],
    'success' => false,
    'error_message' => "Read-only violation: {$reason}"
]);
```

### **Security Alerts:**
- **Real-time logging** of all blocked attempts
- **User identification** and role tracking
- **IP address logging** for security analysis
- **Pattern analysis** for attack detection

---

## üîÑ **Safe Alternative Generation**

### **When Write Operations Are Blocked:**
```php
// User attempts: "UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000 WHERE id = 1"
// System response: Generates safe alternative

$safeAlternative = [
    'safe_query' => 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 1',
    'explanation' => 'Update operations are not allowed. Showing current record instead.',
    'intent' => 'update_attempt'
];
```

### **Alternative Query Examples:**
```php
// Blocked: INSERT INTO employees (name) VALUES ('John')
// Safe Alternative: SELECT COUNT(*) as current_total FROM employees

// Blocked: DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1  
// Safe Alternative: SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records FROM employees WHERE deleted_at IS NULL

// Blocked: UPDATE employees SET salary = 50000
// Safe Alternative: SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 10
```

## üß™ **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Basic Write Operation Block**
```
Input: "Update employee salary to 60000"
Expected: Blocked with read-only violation error
Result: ‚úÖ PASS - Write operation blocked
```

### **Test 2: SQL Injection Attempt**
```
Input: "Show employees; DROP TABLE employees;"
Expected: Blocked with dangerous pattern detection
Result: ‚úÖ PASS - Injection attempt blocked
```

### **Test 3: File Operation Block**
```
Input: "SELECT * FROM employees INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/data.txt'"
Expected: Blocked with file operation violation
Result: ‚úÖ PASS - File operation blocked
```

### **Test 4: Safe Read Operation**
```
Input: "Show all employees with their departments"
Expected: Allowed and executed successfully
Result: ‚úÖ PASS - Safe query executed
```

### **Test 5: Complex Read Query**
```
Input: "SELECT e.*, d.department FROM employees e LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id"
Expected: Allowed and executed successfully
Result: ‚úÖ PASS - Complex read query executed
```
