## 🧠 **Advanced AI Capabilities**

### **Semantic Understanding**
```php
// Example semantic analysis output
{
    "intent": {
        "primary": "count",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "all_intents": {"count": 0.95, "retrieve": 0.3}
    },
    "entities": {
        "tables": ["employees", "departments"],
        "columns": ["firstname", "lastname", "department_name"],
        "values": {"numbers": ["2024"], "strings": ["IT"]}
    },
    "temporal_context": {
        "period": "this_year",
        "relative_time": "this year"
    },
    "domain_context": {
        "hr_function": "recruitment",
        "confidentiality_level": "normal"
    }
}
```

### **Vector-Based Schema Retrieval**
```php
// Example relevant schema retrieval
{
    "tables": {
        "employees": {"similarity": 0.92, "metadata": {...}},
        "departments": {"similarity": 0.87, "metadata": {...}}
    },
    "columns": {
        "employees.firstname": {"similarity": 0.89},
        "employees.department_id": {"similarity": 0.85}
    },
    "relationships": [
        {
            "from_table": "employees",
            "to_table": "departments",
            "relationship_type": "many_to_one"
        }
    ]
}
```

### **Context-Aware Query Generation**
- **Template-based generation** for common patterns
- **Pattern matching** against successful query history
- **AI-powered generation** for complex queries
- **Strategy selection** based on confidence scores
- **Query optimization** with performance considerations

---

## 🎯 **Enhanced Features**

### **1. Multi-Strategy Query Processing**
```php
$strategies = [
    'template_based' => $this->generateTemplateBasedSQL($analysis, $schema),
    'pattern_matching' => $this->generatePatternMatchedSQL($analysis, $schema),
    'ai_generated' => $this->generateAISQL($question, $analysis, $schema)
];

// Select best strategy based on confidence scores
$bestStrategy = $this->selectBestStrategy($strategies, $analysis);
```

### **2. Enterprise-Grade Validation**
```php
$validations = [
    'syntax' => $this->validateSQLSyntax($sqlQuery),
    'security' => $this->validateSQLSecurity($sqlQuery),
    'performance' => $this->validateSQLPerformance($sqlQuery),
    'compliance' => $this->validateDataCompliance($sqlQuery),
    'authorization' => $this->validateUserAuthorization($sqlQuery)
];
```

### **3. AI-Enhanced Results**
```php
return [
    'data' => $formattedData,
    'insights' => $this->generateInsights($data, $analysis),
    'recommendations' => $this->generateRecommendations($data, $analysis),
    'summary' => $this->generateDataSummary($data, $analysis)
];
```

### **4. Confidence Scoring**
```php
$confidenceScore = $this->calculateConfidenceScore([
    'intent_confidence' => $semanticAnalysis['intent']['confidence'],
    'schema_relevance' => $this->calculateSchemaRelevance($analysis),
    'result_consistency' => $this->checkResultConsistency($result),
    'query_complexity_match' => $this->assessComplexityMatch($analysis, $result)
]);
```

## 🔍 **Advanced Query Examples**

### **Natural Language Processing**
```
User: "Show me employees who joined this year in the IT department with their salaries"

Semantic Analysis:
- Intent: retrieve (confidence: 0.92)
- Entities: employees, departments, salary
- Temporal: this_year
- Domain: recruitment, compensation

Vector Search Results:
- employees table (similarity: 0.95)
- departments table (similarity: 0.88)
- salary_disbursements table (similarity: 0.82)

Generated Query:
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, e.basic_salary, d.department_name, e.joining_date
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id 
WHERE YEAR(e.joining_date) = YEAR(CURDATE()) 
AND d.department_name = 'IT'
ORDER BY e.joining_date DESC

AI Response: "I found 12 employees who joined the IT department this year. Here's their information with salary details..."
```

### **Complex Analytics**
```
User: "What's the average salary by department and how does it compare to last year?"

Semantic Analysis:
- Intent: aggregate (confidence: 0.94)
- Aggregation: AVG
- Temporal: this_year vs last_year
- Domain: compensation

AI Response: "Here's the department-wise salary analysis with year-over-year comparison:
- IT Department: $65,000 average (↑8% from last year)
- HR Department: $58,000 average (↑5% from last year)
- Finance: $72,000 average (↑12% from last year)

Insights: IT department shows strong salary growth, indicating competitive market adjustments.
Recommendation: Consider reviewing compensation strategy for HR department to maintain competitiveness."
```
