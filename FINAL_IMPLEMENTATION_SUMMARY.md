## üí° **Example Interactions**

### **Advanced Natural Language Processing**
```
User: "Show me employees who joined this year in IT with their salaries and compare to last year's hires"

System Processing:
1. Semantic Analysis:
   - Intent: retrieve + analyze (confidence: 0.94)
   - Entities: employees, departments, salary_disbursements
   - Temporal: this_year vs last_year
   - Domain: recruitment + compensation

2. Vector Search:
   - employees table (similarity: 0.95)
   - departments table (similarity: 0.88)
   - salary_disbursements table (similarity: 0.82)

3. Generated Response:
   "I found 15 employees who joined IT this year vs 12 last year (+25% growth).
   
   This Year's Hires:
   - Average Salary: $68,500
   - Experience Level: 65% mid-level, 35% senior
   
   Comparison to Last Year:
   - Salary increase: +8% average
   - Hiring pace: +25% volume
   
   Insights: Strong growth in IT hiring with competitive salary adjustments.
   Recommendation: Consider expanding IT team capacity planning for next quarter."

Suggested Follow-ups:
- "Show me the skill distribution of new IT hires"
- "What's the retention rate for IT employees?"
- "Compare IT hiring costs to other departments"
```

### **Complex Analytics with Insights**
```
User: "Analyze attendance patterns and identify potential issues"

AI Response:
"Attendance Analysis Results:

Overall Metrics:
- Average attendance rate: 94.2%
- Late arrivals: 8.3% of check-ins
- Early departures: 3.1% of check-outs

Department Breakdown:
- IT: 96.1% (‚Üë2% from last month)
- Sales: 91.8% (‚Üì3% from last month) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- HR: 95.4% (stable)

Identified Issues:
1. Sales team showing declining attendance trend
2. Friday attendance 12% lower than Monday-Thursday
3. Remote work correlation with improved punctuality

Recommendations:
1. Review Sales team workload and engagement
2. Consider flexible Friday arrangements
3. Expand remote work options for improved work-life balance

Would you like me to analyze specific employees or time periods?"
