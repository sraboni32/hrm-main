Result: Returns 15 employees with full details
```

## üìà **Performance & Scalability**

### **Optimizations**
- Query result limiting (default 100 records)
- Efficient JOIN strategies
- Index-aware query generation
- Caching for schema information

### **Monitoring**
- Execution time tracking
- Query complexity analysis
- Resource usage monitoring
- Performance bottleneck detection

## üîÆ **Advanced Features**

### **Smart Query Enhancement**
- Automatic JOIN detection
- Relationship inference
- Data type optimization
- Query performance suggestions

### **Context Awareness**
- Previous conversation history
- User role-based suggestions
- Department/company context
