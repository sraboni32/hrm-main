## üß† **Enhanced AI Intelligence**

### **Smart Table Detection**
The AI can now identify tables from natural language using:
- **Direct table names**: "employees", "projects", "attendance"
- **Keywords**: "staff" ‚Üí employees, "pay" ‚Üí salary_disbursements
- **Context clues**: "who" ‚Üí employees, "when" ‚Üí attendance
- **Synonyms**: "personnel", "workers", "team members" ‚Üí employees

### **Intelligent Field Recognition**
The AI understands field references through:
- **Direct field names**: "basic_salary", "joining_date", "department_id"
- **Natural language**: "name" ‚Üí firstname + lastname, "salary" ‚Üí basic_salary
- **Context mapping**: "leave" ‚Üí sick_leave + casual_leave + total_leave
- **Relationship awareness**: department ‚Üí department_name from departments table

### **Advanced Query Generation**
- **Smart JOINs**: Automatically joins related tables (employees ‚Üî departments)
- **Proper SELECT clauses**: Context-aware column selection
- **Intelligent WHERE conditions**: Date ranges, numeric comparisons, status filters
- **Aggregation support**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN operations

## üîç **Query Examples That Now Work**

### **Simple Queries**
```
"How many employees do we have?" 
‚Üí SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees

"Show me all department names"
‚Üí SELECT department_name FROM departments

"List project titles and their status"
‚Üí SELECT title, status FROM projects
```

### **Complex Relationship Queries**
```
"Show employees with their department names and salaries"
‚Üí SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, e.basic_salary, d.department_name 
  FROM employees e LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id

"Find projects with client information and budgets"
‚Üí SELECT p.title, p.budget, CONCAT(c.firstname, ' ', c.lastname) as client_name
  FROM projects p LEFT JOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.id
```

### **Advanced Analytics**
```
"Show average salary by department"
‚Üí SELECT d.department_name, AVG(e.basic_salary) as avg_salary
  FROM employees e LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
  GROUP BY d.department_name

"Find employees with more than 10 sick leaves this year"
‚Üí SELECT firstname, lastname, sick_leave FROM employees 
  WHERE sick_leave > 10 AND YEAR(created_at) = YEAR(NOW())
```
